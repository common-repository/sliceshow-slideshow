== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Images from slideshow.. where are they from? =

The pictures that appear in the slideshow are taken from post from the custom field with the name "image" or from the inside of the post (if you add a image inside of a post). The custom field named "image" has priority over the images inside the post. 

= Add jQuery Call? What is this? =

If you are already using jQuery (you have jQuery active) trough another plugin or the theme then leave this checkbox unchecked. If you don't have jQuery enabled on your theme, check the checkbox or the slideshow will not work!

= What happens if I don't set a width and a height for the slideshow? =

It has default values of 995(width) and 365(height). These values will be used if width and height textboxes are lef empty
